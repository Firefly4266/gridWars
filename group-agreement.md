# Group agreement

- Communication plan: A slack group will be created for enhanced communication.  Before any code is worked on remotely, the group  should be consulted via the channel so that no two people working remotely write redundant or conflicting code. NO TEAM MEMBER IS TO MERGE THEIR OWN CODE. 
- Conflict plan: Any conflicts that arise are to be discussed as calmly as possible by all of the team members since we are all effected either directly or indirectly.  Although we want to do our best, this is not a life and death situation...it's a class project with a specific end goal...to demonstrate we have command over the technologies covered in the last 3 weeks. 
- Work plan: After our initial wire framing, flow will consist of working in pairs to accomplish specific objectives to achieve MVP. The scope of the pair programming should be as small as possible and should be committed once it is functioning properly and before another task is started. 

- Git process: 

- Remember, this is a team effort.  If we cannot collectively agree on a feature or a direction, a group conference should be held for a 15 minute time period after which A time period for implementation will be set or the feature/direction will be dropped.
