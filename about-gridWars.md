## Gameplay

The game opens to a gameboard with a submarine (sub) that is hidden at a random location corresponding with three paired gameboard coordinates. Each coordinate location is associated with a gameboard longitudinal (column) coordinate and a latitudinal (row) coordinate between 1 and 10, e.g., (3, 5).


## Game Objective

The object of the game is to locate and fire upon all three hidden sub coordinates within 10 tries. If the player hits all three locations, the sub is destroyed and the player wins.

## Scoring

Every hit on the sub scores 1 point, the player will win once the life of the sub has been depleted.
