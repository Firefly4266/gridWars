## <span style="color:red">Gameplay</span>

<span style="color:lightblue">The game begins with a gameboard with a submarine (sub) that is hidden at a random location corresponding with three paired gameboard coordinates. Each coordinate location is associated with a gameboard longitudinal (column) coordinate and a latitudinal (row) coordinate between 1 and 10, e.g., (3, 5).
</span>

## <span style="color:red">Game Objective</span>

 <span style="color:lightblue">The object of the game is to locate and fire upon all three hidden sub coordinates within 10 tries. If the player hits all three locations, the sub is destroyed and the player wins.</span>

## <span style="color:red">Scoring</span>

<span style="color:lightblue">Scoring is dependent upon how quickly the player finds and fires upon the three coordinates associated with the sub's hidden location. If the player hits a sub with the very first hit, player earns 10 points, with the second, 9 points, with the third 8 points, etc. Thus, the maximum points in one game is 27.</span>
